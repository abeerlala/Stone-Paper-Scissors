This is a fun and simple **Stone Paper Scissors** game where you play against the computer. I built it using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to sharpen my frontend skills and practice basic game logic.

## ✨ Features

- Single-player mode vs computer
- Random computer moves
- Win, lose, or draw detection
- Clean and responsive UI
- Score tracking (optional, if you added it)

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for layout and structure
- **CSS** – for styling the interface
- **JavaScript** – for handling game logic and interactivity

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Generating random values with JavaScript
- Comparing player vs computer choices
- Updating the DOM based on game outcomes
- Writing clean and readable code

## 📌 Note

This is a small **practice project** meant to improve my JavaScript fundamentals. Suggestions and feedback are welcome!
